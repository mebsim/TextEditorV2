# TextEditorV2

As opposed to the first version of this program, this version is made to only be the front end of the text editor. It does not handle file creating or saving. It only deals with text input and displaying it on the screen.

It is created with LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) in order to use OpenGL and Slick2D.
